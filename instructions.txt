Instructions
Build a basic blog page that has 3 articles and any random topics you want to talk about. The text can be anything, even placeholder text ( look at this lorem ipsum text generator for an example of the official unofficial gibberish of web developers everywhere ). The blog page should contain the following:

An appropriate document structure and meta
A page header containing the blog's title
A page footer containing the copyright notice (view pretty much any web site to see an example)
Each article has a header containing a title
Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date
Each article has an accompanying image with appropriate accessibility descriptions
Each article has at least one section
Submit a link to your repo or codepen called "01-challenge-html"
